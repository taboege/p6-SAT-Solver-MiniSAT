  + Error handling. MiniSAT and some other solvers print predictable
    messages in common error scenarios, like invalid DIMACS file.

  + Unify interfaces. SAT::Solver should provide the standard role
    for SAT solvers. Error types should be defined there as well.
    Taking DIMACS input even overlaps with the other variants of
    SAT solving.

  + Configurability. Offer command-line options to callers.

  + Maybe export a sub that hides the object creation and maybe
    a version that automatically awaits the Promise.

  + lingeling is another SAT solver which does produce a witness.
    That is another module though. I wonder if MiniSAT just throws
    its witness away and we can hack it not to.
