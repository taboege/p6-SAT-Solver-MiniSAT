  + remove the :now adverb in favor of a dedicated method.

  + Determine how to keep the execute bit on the program when zef is
    installing it. Then remove the BEGIN hack we're currently doing.

  + Use the exit codes of MiniSAT instead of reading its output.
  + This can also help with error handling. Is it enough or do we
    have to capture its output?

  + Make all the diagnostic noise optional in my copy of MiniSAT.
    Add an option to write a real DIMACS output file to stdout
    instead of it, which also contains the model found in case
    of SAT. MiniSAT can currently only emit the witness if you
    provide a file (not "-") after the input file.
  + Hack MiniSAT to understand my * convention for variable and
    clause counts as "look for yourself". Add support for that
    to the module.

  + We ship our own version of MiniSAT with patches. In a future
    version maybe also support system MiniSATs, but YAGNI unless
    someone wants to use *their* patched MiniSAT with custom
    features... Then we should support passing arbitrary named
    args to the process.
  + Configurability. Offer command-line options to callers.
