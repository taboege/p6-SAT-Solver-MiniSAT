  + Determine how to keep the execute bit on the program when zef is
    installing it. Then remove the BEGIN hack we're currently doing.

  + Use the exit codes of MiniSAT instead of reading its output.

  + Error handling. MiniSAT and some other solvers print predictable
    messages in common error scenarios, like invalid DIMACS file.

  + Configurability. Offer command-line options to callers.

  + Provide my own hack of MiniSAT which: produces a witness for
    satisfiability, and can handle variable and clause count of 0,
    meaning "look for yourself".
  + Still allow working with the standard MiniSAT.
